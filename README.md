# SJ Webdev Services — Website (v2 redesign)

Hand-coded static site. No frameworks, no build step, no dependencies.
Stack: HTML5 · CSS3 · vanilla JavaScript · Space Grotesk + JetBrains Mono (Google Fonts).

## Files

```
index.html        Home
about.html        About (new — split out from the old about-services.html)
services.html     Services (8 services, process, FAQ)
portfolio.html    Portfolio (30 projects, live filters)
contact.html      Contact (cards + enquiry form)
404.html          Custom not-found page
css/style.css     Full design system (dark + light themes)
js/main.js        Theme toggle, mobile nav, reveals, counters, filters, form
robots.txt        Allows crawling, points to sitemap
sitemap.xml       All 5 pages, canonical domain
.htaccess         301 redirect old about-services.html → services.html,
                  404 handler, caching, gzip
```

## Deploying to Bluehost (sjwebdevservices.com)

1. Open cPanel → File Manager → `public_html`.
2. Upload the contents of this folder (not the folder itself) into `public_html`.
   Make sure "Show hidden files" is on so `.htaccess` uploads too.
3. Keep your existing `/assets/og-image.png` on the server — the social
   preview tags point to it. (If it's missing, upload any 1200×630 PNG there.)
4. Done. No database, no PHP, nothing to configure.

## Theme toggle

- Sun/moon button in the header switches dark ↔ light.
- The visitor's choice is saved in `localStorage` (`sj-theme`).
- First visit follows the device's `prefers-color-scheme`.
- An inline script in `<head>` applies the theme before paint (no flash).

## Contact form

The form is static-host friendly: on submit it opens the visitor's email app
with a fully pre-filled message to sjwebdevservices@gmail.com (name, phone,
company, service, budget, message). If you later want submissions delivered
without the email app step, swap the form to a service like FormSubmit or
Formspree — the markup is ready; just add an `action` and `method="POST"`.

## Portfolio thumbnails

Thumbnails use the same WordPress mShots screenshot service as the current
site, so they always show the live client sites and need no image files.
First-ever load of a thumbnail can take a few seconds while mShots renders it.

## SEO checklist (already done)

- Unique title + meta description per page
- Canonical URLs on sjwebdevservices.com
- Open Graph + Twitter cards on every page
- JSON-LD: ProfessionalService, WebSite, AboutPage, FAQPage,
  ItemList (services), CollectionPage, ContactPage, BreadcrumbList
- Semantic landmarks, one h1 per page, alt text on all images
- sitemap.xml + robots.txt (submit the sitemap in Google Search Console)
- 301 redirect preserves link equity from the old about-services.html URL
